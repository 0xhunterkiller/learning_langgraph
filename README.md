# Learning Langgraph

I was following a nice course on langgraph, with exercises and everything. Uploading to github for later reference.

The author of the course also uploaded the ppts on github: [Github: iamvaibhavmehra/LangGraph-Course-freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/iamvaibhavmehra/LangGraph-Course-freeCodeCamp)

This is the video on FreeCodeCamp: [LangGraph Complete Course for Beginners â€“ Complex AI Agents with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM)
